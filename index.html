              <p class="caption">After receiving a feedback that our problem presentation is confusing, we revised our first storyboard. We concluded to emphasize on "skipping breakfast" as major problem. Thus, I came up with new storyboard. These revised storyboard images are for the first half of the video, which is about daily morning routine of a typical, tired college student. We wanted to present that typical college student skips his/her breakfast due to not enough time to cook or buy. For the other half, we demonstrated major functions of our application, such as Instant Order.</p>

          <p class="caption">We designed a breakfast coupon providing application called "APPetite" in order to solve the problem of skipping breakfast. Since we could not build actual application, we cannot tell this application will solve the problem or not. However, we can tell this application design is ideal since it is iterated for several times based on feedback and research. If "APPetite" is really built, we expect it to make college students have their breakfast so that their academic performance won't be affected. We hope them to 'survive college'.</p>

          <p class="caption">Nothing was easy for each assignemnt. However, I could complete all tasks with the help from my teammates, Alyssa and Stacy. I believe our teamwork played important role to achieve the group assignments. During entire quarter, we had 5~6 face-to-face meetings and 2~3 online meetings. These meetings allowed to have better communication which led to better result. Moreover, this group project helped to find which role in a group fits me the most.</p>
          <p class="caption">Flashing back entire design process, I think I could learn how to think as a designer. Designing consists of identifying the problem, ideating possible solution, creating prototype and testing. Each stage has repetition of critique and refinement before moving on the next stage. This valuable experience helped me to expand my design perspective.</p>
